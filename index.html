            <h1>Why you need a website&#63;</h1>
            <p>It is a very common myth that websites or landing pages are only for those huge brands, companies, or enterprises. However, that is simply <span class="bold">NOT</span> the case!</p><br>
            <p>In fact, if you own a small or medium sized business and you have big plans for this business, you <span class="bold">should</span> definitely start establishing your online presence with a quality website. Yes, social media platforms are a good way to start (and you should utilize them if you haven’t yet), but along the way this is not going to be enough!</p><br>
            <p>Here are some reasons why you should consider giving your business a website now:
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="bold accented">A website is the anchor or center of your marketing startegies</span> 	&#8211; you probably have seen huge business successes on the internet like a company that just got more than 100% ROI in just 1 week, a 300% increase in their monthly sales, and more. Well, they have surely achieved these results through the utilization of specially engineered or designed websites or landing pages paired with other marketing tactics like social media advertising. Bottomline, a website brings out the most out of your marketing efforts.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold accented">24/7 marketing</span> &#8211; having a website is just like having a salesperson who does the guiding, entertaining, and closing to the potential customers for you. Only difference is that websites never sleep, never get tired, and can serve prospects from anywhere effortlessly with accuracy.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold accented">Builds credibility</span> &#8211; when your business has a website, there is more probability that you become top-of-mind when people in the marketplace talks about stuff related to your niche. And lastly...</li>
                    <li><span class="bold accented">You have full control of your online destiny</span> &#8211; you see, when you are just relying on social media platforms, the destiny of your business will depend on that certain platform’s algorithm and system, whereas having your own website is like owning a piece of land or property on the internet. You can do basically whatever you want. You have full control on what your audience see about your business.</li>
                </ol>
            </p><br>
            <p>And one more thing, when marketing online, people usually immediately go to <span class="bold">running ads on social media</span>. Please <span class="bold">DON&#39;T</span> do this common mistake!</p><br>
            <p>In order to become <span class="bold">profitable</span> on social media advertising, you are gonna need the <span class="bold">advanced benefits</span> of having a website integrated into your advertising campaigns (Facebook Pixel, Analytics, etc.).</p>

                <p><q>He is a goal-oriented person. He doesn't need any one to manage him from time to time, he knows what to do and he puts his effort at his best. It was from the first time I got a call from him, while listening to his insights, I  got excited already because of how he explained well the procedure and the strategies that could help my business which I had never thought of.  Moreover, he managed his time accordingly as he also gave his client enough time to prepare-and-proceed also. He doesn't just plainly do his job but he has the character to help businesses improve, and that's the reason why I proceeded working with him. He's just so passionate with what he does that it became so contagious. I definitely recommend other business-owners as well to give Mr. Pableo a shot and book a call with him for your web development inquiries!</q></p>
